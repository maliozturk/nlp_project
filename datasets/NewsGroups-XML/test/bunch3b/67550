Subject: Xw widget set ported to X11R5??

I'm trying to compile xftp which uses the Xw widget set and I'm having
problems.  We're using Motif and X11R5 and it seems that my version of the
Xw stuff was only ported to R3.  Are there patches out to port this to R5
(or a newer port altogether)??

Or perhaps a newer port of xftp for use with R5??
Thanks in advance.
