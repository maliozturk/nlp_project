If you want info claiming that blacks were brought to earth 60 trillion
years ago by Aliens from the plante Shabazz, I can send you literature from
the Nation of Islam (<true_name> Farrakhan </true_name> 's group) who believe this.

If you want info claiming that the Holocaust never happened, I can send you
info from IHR (Institute for Historical Review - <true_name> David Irving </true_name> 's group), or
just read <true_name> Dan Gannon </true_name> 's posts on alt.revisionism.

I just wanted to put <true_name> Steve </true_name> 's post in with the company that it deserves.
