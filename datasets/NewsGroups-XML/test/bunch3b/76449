First, the following two quite normal phrases:    

>  Why did not anyone venture to answer <true_name> Andi </true_name> 's question in an intelligent
>  and unoffending manner?                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^   
       ^^^^^^^^^^^
>  Now will we please start having some INTELLIGENT conversation?
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^   

and then he shows us what HE means by "intelligent and unoffending manner" 
and "INTELLIGENT conversation":   

>  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^

                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

>  You all are an insult to you race! {assuming you are also semitic} 
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
   [...deleted lines...]
                                                    

   Later he reveals the truth:

>  ... I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part Jewish] .....
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
   [...deleted lines...] 

   Shurely he IS an anti-Semite (call it anti-Jew), maybe BECAUSE he
   is "part Jewish"  (e.g. his mother might have *dated*  a Jew who
   didn't marry her, and so she got a little bastard whom she taught
   hatred).  
   
   He is also a coward since he doesn't dare to sign with his name.  
   At the end he signs with a highly intelligent and intellectual 
   phrase:   
 
>                            Pissed off at Immature,
>                          Closeminded, Self righteous
>	                            Semites

   The  Nazis  might also have sent this bastard to the gas chambers
   because of his "part Jewish"ness (only that he is not aware of it).   

PS: I wonder what kind of educational institution is @virginia.edu.
    Could it be the "Free KKK-University of Virginia" ? ;-)
