   This is historically incorrect.  Early Zionist 'fighters' did indeed
   target civilians.  They made random attacks in Arab marketplaces,
   killing innocent passers-by.  Your assertion of the opposite is an
   attempt to whitewash history.  Anyone can read about the history of
   the Zionist terrorists.  A good book to start is the one by <true_name> J. Bowyer
   Bell </true_name> , an expert in international terrorism.  (His main interest is
   Irish terrorism.)

I am not denying that this type of incident occurred, however, you are
overlooking the fact that:
	1. Lehi/Etzel were proportionally smaller, as was their support.
	2. The mainstream organization, and the majority of the population
	   at the time, abhored their methods.
This was not the case for the Palestinian movements that targetted
civilians.  There was no "mainstream" palestinian movement advocating
negotiation and diplomatic approaches, or condemning these actions.
