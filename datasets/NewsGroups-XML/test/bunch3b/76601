                           AIRLINE TICKET 

                        ATA TO CINCINNATI

I have a friend who has one ticket from ATLANTA to CIN, OH.  It is one seat
in economy class on Delta.  The ticket is the return half of a round trip.
It is currently in a woman's name.  She does not need to fly back.  Need to
sell the ticket.  Flyer would go standby because ticket is dated. Asking $90.

I am posting this for my friend.  Please do not email responses to me.
Instead contact <true_name> Rick  </true_name> at 513-271-4169.
