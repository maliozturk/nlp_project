Yeah. Innocents. People who hoard $250K worth of high-caliber automatic weapons
and kill law-enforcement agents really fit the bill here. The only innocents
were the 20+ children who were prevented from leaving a burning building by
their self-appointed messiah-following parents. A burning STARTED by the 
Davidians.

Is this subject line a veiled threat against U.S. Government agents or possibly
Executive office leadership (i.e. Clinton)? I've considered you a bit of a loon,
before, <true_name> Stephen </true_name> , I guess this pretty much confirms it. 

Nice religion you have there.  The only ones who should be killed are those who
don't agree with us. Sheesh.
