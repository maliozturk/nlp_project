That is indeed the present consensus.  Contrary to what <true_name> Dr. Fox  </true_name> has
been saying, however, present consensus is *not* that the longer
passage in <true_name> Josephus  </true_name> about <true_name> Jesus  </true_name> was inserted, but only that it was
modified.
   There is no question that it was *at least* modified (based on what
Origen says--that <true_name> Josephus  </true_name> did not recognize <true_name> Jesus  </true_name> as the Messiah), but
I don't think the argument that it appears "out of context" is a very
good one.  (I haven't looked at the context for a while; perhaps somebody
could give some of the sentences which precede and follow the <true_name> Jesus
 </true_name> passage.)
