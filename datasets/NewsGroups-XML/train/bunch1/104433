That plastic bodywork is useless. That torque, and an upright riding position is
better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm
low torque motor.

To a cruiser-motorcyclist, chrome has some importance. To sport-bike motorcyclists
chrome has very little impact on buying choice.

Unless motivated solely by price, these are the criteria each rider uses to select
the vehicle of choice. 

To ignore these, as well as other criteria, would be insensitive. In other words,
no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser
rider may have.(sometimes it's hard for *any* motorcycle to fufill a person's requirements)
  
You're fishing for flames, <true_name> Dave </true_name> .

This difference of opinion is analogous to the difference
between Sports-car owners, and luxury-car owners. 

This is a moot conversation.
