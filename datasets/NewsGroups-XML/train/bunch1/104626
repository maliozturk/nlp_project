According to the Atlanta paper, <true_name> Bream  </true_name> will be the full-time first baseman
with <true_name> Klesko  </true_name> used as a late-inning defensive replacement if <true_name> Bream  </true_name> is lifted
for a pinch-runner. He'd have to hit a homer in his first AB (or win the
game or do some other amazing thing) to be rewarded with a start so he could
even attempt to push <true_name> Hunter  </true_name> or <true_name> Bream  </true_name> out of the lineup.
