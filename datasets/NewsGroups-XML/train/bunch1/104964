Yes, but

	(a) we were talking about peak level, not career averages
and
	(b) <true_name> Clemente  </true_name> was the best fielding RF of all time, as far
	    as anyone can tell

I did a quick scan last night, looking for players with a peak comparable
to or better than <true_name> Winfield </true_name> .  In my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement, you
could make good cases for <true_name> Ruth </true_name> , <true_name> Aaron </true_name> , <true_name> Ott </true_name> , <true_name> Robinson </true_name> , <true_name> Clemente </true_name> , <true_name> Kaline </true_name> , 
<true_name> Maris </true_name> , <true_name> Klein </true_name> , <true_name> Jackson </true_name> , <true_name> Waner </true_name> , and probably a few others.  This is not a
knock on Winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other
players had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while <true_name> Winfield  </true_name> has
been more uniformly excellent.  Hall of Fame?  Absolutely.  Top-10 peak?
I'm not so sure.  Top 10 total career value?  Yes, almost certainly.
