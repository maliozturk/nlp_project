I watched the final inning of <true_name> Bosio </true_name> 's no-hitter with several people at
work. After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the
middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he
wouldn't have had time to throw <true_name> Riles  </true_name> out. Yet, the throw beat <true_name> Riles
 </true_name> by about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out
think <true_name> Vizquel  </true_name> had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.
Does anybody think <true_name> Vizquel  </true_name> was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And
if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an
error or a hit? (Judging from <true_name> Bosio </true_name> 's grimace when the ball bounced
past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether
<true_name> Vizquel  </true_name> was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.
