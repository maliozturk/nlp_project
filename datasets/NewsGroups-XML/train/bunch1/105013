0 for 2, ma_ind25.

<true_name> Daniel Patrick Staub  </true_name> is a Catholic school kid from Nawlins, <true_name> Mordecai
Brown  </true_name> a farm kid (probably Protestant) from somewhere in the Midwest.
He lost those fingers in a farm machinery accident.

Jim <true_name> Palmer  </true_name> isn't Jewish himself, but Mr. <true_name> Jockey Shorts </true_name> 's adoptive 
parents are.

Also, I'm not absolutely certain that <true_name> Carew  </true_name> actually converted.  His
wife and children certainly are Jewish.
