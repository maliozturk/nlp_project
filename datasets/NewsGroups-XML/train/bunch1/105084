All they said on the radio that he developed stiffness in the shoulder
after throwing a curveball that didn't loosen.  Because of the cold
night in Denver they decided to remove him from the game rather than
let him pitch.  He is expected to pitch his next turn in the rotation
(expected to be April 20, at Shea vs the Giants).
