I was at that game, behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the 
radar gun.  The 1991 season was winding down and <true_name> Roger  </true_name> didn't have his 
best fastball, topping out at 88-90 (in contrast to <true_name> Frank Tanana </true_name> , who went 
as low as 50 with one lollipop in the process of striking out <true_name> Phil 
Plantier  </true_name> *five* times on the night).  <true_name> Inky </true_name> 's shot would have gone further
than any I've ever seen if it hadn't crashed *into* the lights (not the 
lightstand) as you say over 100 feet high, <true_name> Roy Hobbs </true_name> -like, and bounced 
back onto the field.  That had to have been a 525-footer if unobstructed,
edging out <true_name> Bo Jackson </true_name> 's drive off Oil Can Boyd to the top of the
centerfield bleacher back wall in 1988 for the best I've seen personally 
(I was sitting under that one).
