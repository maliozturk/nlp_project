<true_name> Matt </true_name> 's problem is really more ability than attitude.  It isn't that he's
got it in his mind that he wants to swing away, but rather that he's
(still) a total sucker for the curve ball.  It looked for a while in
1990 that he was getting better but it's still his weak point.

As to whether it does him any good to have <true_name> Bonds  </true_name> behind him, the 
net.stat.mavens will probably tell you there's no reason that it
should, but if he thinks it will, it might be a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

As to whether the Giants' lineup is optimal:  who knows?  Batting Bonds,
the team's best hitter, fifth does seem to be odd, but the #1 and #2
hitters aren't exactly Messrs. OBA, so they aren't giving much up
there.  And although Clark isn't the overall offensive force that <true_name> Bonds
 </true_name> is, he seems better suited to the #3 spot.  Assuming, of course, that
he starts hitting one of these days...
