I don't generally consider police officers "the enemy".  I hope you don't
think bikers in general have that attitude.  Stereotypes suck either way.

You shouldn't get flamed for being a cop.  I can't promise you won't because
there are jerks on this newsgroup same as any other, but if you've been 
lurking for a while you already know that.  You might get lots of flames
if you try to convince people that you know more than them just because you
have a badge.  And of course, you will get a moderate amount of flamage
just for expressing an opinion, no matter what the opinion is *somebody*
will flame you for it.
   So, have you ordered any official DoD paraphenalia yet?  Wristwatch,
bandana, patches?  Tell your boss your going undercover with a real
badass biker gang. :-)
