Yes, it is -- you could look it up.  And spare us the thin-skinned
indignation, please; what's sauce for four years of using <true_name> George Herbert
Walker Bush  </true_name> and <true_name> J. Danforth Quayle  </true_name> as an insult is sauce for <true_name> William
Jefferson Blythe Clinton </true_name> .  Do you feel that calling a President by his full 
name implies some sort of disrespect?  Hint: this is a rhetorical question.
