  Are there any members of conservative, religious, politically active groups
(such as the Christian Coalition) out there?  I come from a very liberal 
background, and I'd like to talk to some conservative people out there in a 
public forum (such as this one.)  I frankly can't understand the rationale or
Christian basis for much of the conservative position, and I'd like to try and
learn more about this movement--after all, we're part of the same church.  Is
anyone interested in explaining a bit about the conservative viewpoint?
  Thanks.
