Yes, Duo prices have dropped.  I don't have the MSRP reductions,
(though you can find it in a recent TidBITS, archived at sumex)
but here's the Berkeley educational price list (old -> new)

Duo 210 4/80        $1919 -> 1569
Duo 230 4/80        $2225 -> 1961
Duo 230 4/120       $2532 -> 2268
Duo 230 4/120/modem $2746 -> 2473

So there.
