<true_name> Tammy </true_name> , is this all explicitly stated in the bible, or do you assume
that you know that <true_name> Ezekiel  </true_name> indirectly mentioned? It could have been
another metaphor, for instance <true_name> Ezekiel  </true_name> was mad at his landlord, so he
talked about him when he wrote about the prince of Tyre.

Sorry, but my interpretation is more mundane, <true_name> Ezekiel  </true_name> wrote about 
the prince of Tyre when we wrote about the prince of Tyre.
