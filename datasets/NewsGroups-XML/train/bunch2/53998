The overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the Quebec 
defender who deflected the puck.  The re-play officials did not 
take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first 
non-goal, so it seemed pretty non-controversial.

into form.  Hopefully the sign of good things to come...
