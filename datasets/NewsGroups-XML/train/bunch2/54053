It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio, but I seem
to remember that PeP is actually 4x the "real" power.  Which makes 1KW PeP
actually around 250W.  Or was it 2x?  I disremember.

"Effective transmitted power" is also "odd", in that it takes into account
antenna height and geometry.  Which is why a TV station with a 50KW Klystron
might advertise a megawatt (if their antenna is on the top of the
CN tower ;-).

This is like Sears HP ;-)

Though, 1500 real watts still isn't impossible.  About 125-150A with
a 12V alternator, less if the alternator produces higher voltages.

It's only three horsepower (taking into account inefficiencies).  You'll
feel it when you hit the key.  But not too much.
