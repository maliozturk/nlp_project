Gee, how about an (ahem) "accelerometer"! Such devices are available from
a variety of sources (one that comes to mind is Bruel & Kjaer if you have
a lot of money to spend). MOst of these sorts of devices output a voltage
proportional to acceleration. You need to know what range you're talking
about though.
