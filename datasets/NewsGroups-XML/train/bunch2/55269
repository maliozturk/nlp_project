I wrote a letter the other day to Empower America - the organization
which claims to be championing conservative issues, esp. in the wake 
of the Republican defeat last fall. 

Some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of 
support among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for '96 run.

You'd be close to the truth.

Their two leading spokesmen are <true_name> Bill Bennett </true_name> , former 'Drug Czar' who heartily
supported <true_name> Bush </true_name> 's semi-auto import ban, and wondered if it went far enough - 
who helped put the big lie about 'sporting use' into the public's eye - and
<true_name> Jack Kemp  </true_name> - who recently came out in support of semi-auto bans. 

These are conservatives ? 

Anyway I thought it interesting that when I ran Word Perfect's spell check
against my letter - it came up with the following corrections for 'Bennett' :

1. Banned
2. Bayonet


Needless to say, I found these choices rather amusing.

"It [collectivism vs individualism] is an ancient conflict. Men have come
close to the truth, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell
after another. Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The
savage's whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe.
Civilization is the process of setting man free from men."
