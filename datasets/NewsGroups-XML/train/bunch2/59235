Yes, there is such a thing as eye dominance, although I am not sure if
this dominance refers to perscription strength.

As i recall, if you selectively close your dominant eye, you will percieve
that the image shifts. This will not happen if you close your other eye.

I believe that which eye is dominant is related to handedness, but I
can't recall the relation at the moment.
