There's a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shopping
mall, offering free examinations.  Part of the process involves a
multiple-jointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer-
sounding voice "digitize left PSIS" "digitize right PSIS" "digitize
C7" "please stand with spine in neutral position".  I'm wondering
whether this doesn't really measure anything and the computer voice
is to impress the victims, or whether it is measuring something
that chiropractors think is useful to measure.
