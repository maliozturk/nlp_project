I wonder why the term "bio-engineered" was added to the comment? As I
review the problems of Space Biosphere2 in Arizona, and work on
modelling a new composting/vermiculture system to propose for the next
generation of closed system environments, I believe that biological
carbon sinks are essential to help regulate CO2. In my models, humus is
an optimum carbon repository that can help buffer increases in
atmpospheric CO2. Why consider "bio-engineering" some mythical plant
when the existing organisms are well suited to the task if managed
properly?
