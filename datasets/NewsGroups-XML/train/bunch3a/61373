  That's _Five Weeks In A Balloon_.  And if anyone can tell me where to
get it, I sure would like a reply!  I've been looking for that book for
TEN YEAR+, and never found it.  (Note that I am _not_ looking for a $200
collector's item; I'm hoping that *someone* has published it in modern
times, either in paperback or hardcover.  I'm willing to spend $50 or
so to get a copy.
